In this comparison or balancing of his countrymen with
foreigners we should naturally look for some disparage
ment of the latter. But everywhere in the portions of his
work that have come down tous, we are forced to recog·
niae his faimess and impartiality. Even when a foreigner
gains hIs glory at the expense of Romans, as was true of
Hannibal, Nepos shows the highest admiration for his

exploits and in no way attempts to belittle his achieve
ments. ' ’

We find manymistakes and inaccuracies in his historical
statementS‚ but in view of¹ the great task he undertook‚ of
his haste to finish the work begun only late in life, and
of his being· the first Roman historian to use foreign
authorities this need not excite our surprise.
