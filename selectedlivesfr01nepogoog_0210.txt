Pauo 66. 1. Hannibal, etc. .· cf. p. 9, l. 1, with note.

2. quod: ordinarily we find the abl. with¹ de after dubit63
neuter pronouns in the accus. form the only exceptions.

3. ut . . . superirin (for superarent) a result clause where
an accus. and inf. would be more regular after rernm est (G. 571‚c;
H. 571, a).

3. infitiandum: prejudiced Romans might easily do this ; later
several statues of Hannibal were set up at Rome.

4. citeros: we should expect ceteris (dat.); see on omnes,
p. 47, 1. 7. In one tale Hannibal is represented as claiming only
third place, putting Alexander the Great and Pyrrhus before
himself. .

6. antecidat: this is subjunct. by attraction from its depen-
dence on the inf. praestitisse (G. 5933 H. 652).

7. congressus est . . . discessit: sc. Hannibal for subject of
these. Hannibal did meet' with one repulse at the hands of
Marcellus when he attached Nola, a Campanian city, in 21'4.
This was a mere trifle compared with the long list of Hannibal’s‘
victorias, but the Romans made a great deal of it.

8. Quod: therefore.
¹ 9. domi: i.e.‚ while Hannibalwas in the field. He certainly
was not properly supported by his countrymen at home ; but the
fact that the Romans had a number of generals who were more
than a match for any Carthaginien leader other than Hannibal
had much to do with his failure.
