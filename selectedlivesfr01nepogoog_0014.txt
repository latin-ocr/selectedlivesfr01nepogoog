history offers a subject more likely to appeal to the aver-

claim to possess the field to the exclusion of so interesting

the pupil in six weeks or six months torreading Caesar, to
thrust him into the study ol Caesar before he is ready ior

it and to keep him there until he becomes thoroughly
tired of the famous general's campaigns and perhaps of
r Latin as well, aud then to seek to revive him with a taste
ol Vergil’s poetry. Now, however, there are indications
everywhere oi a healthy reaction against this practice, and
the idea is fast gaining ground that the prose oi the pre· 1
paratory course should be more varied for the benefit of
both teacher and pupil. As affording suitable material
for such variety the “Lives of Nepo? have a special
claim to recognition. ,
