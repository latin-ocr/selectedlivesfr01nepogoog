80 NOTES.

Papa 1. 1. Miltiades, Cimonis filius, Atheniensis: these
words serve as a title, but are constructed with the first sentence.
In many of the “Lives'’ Nepos disconneets the first few words
from what follows and gives us a title in quite modern fashion.
Cf, eg, the beginning of Themistocles, Alcibiades, Epaminondas.

1. Cimonis filius: a mistake on Nepos’ part, who confounds
the two men, uncle and nephew, bearing the same name. The'
founder of the colony went to the Chersonesus some forty years
before the hero of Marathon, who was the son of Cimon. The
younger Miltiades succeeded his brother Stesagoras, who had
succeeded the elder Miltiades their uncle. ’ The following is the
genealogy:

Cypselus = the same wife = Stesagoras I.

Miltiailes 1. Cimdn 1.

(the colonist). Ι

Stesagoras II. , Miltiades II.
(the victor at Marathon).

r-ssff

Cimon II. Elpinice.

1. cum: in translating begin with this word ; it is displaced to
allow Miltiades, etc, to bave the first, emphatic position.
’ 1.et...et...ef:notonly...and...butalsa
2. antiquiffite: abl. of cause, depending on floreret.
ι 2. antiquitdte generisi the Greeks were fond of tracing back
their genealogy through a line of distinguished ancestors to some
god or hero ; so Miltiades connected his family line with Aeacus,

. theson of Zeus.

2. sui modestia: hisown unassumingmanncr. Seegroup ΜΗ).

3. finus: is used to'strengthen the superlative maixime.

3. unus omnium maixime floreret: was eminent far above all
others.

3· ei aetite: abl. of quality (G. 415 and note; ll. 473, 2).

ς. cive's . . . sui: hirfellowrcr'tizens, sui irregularly for eius.
