82 NOTES.

in war, inquired of the Delphie oracle for a leader. Hdt. (VI.
36, 37) gives the story. For details consult Classical Dictionary,
under Miltiades.

12. cum quibus: usually cum is appended to the relative,
quibuscum.

13. abminatim: (examine group cuo) how ambiguous the
usual answers of oracles were may be seen from Them. 2, 6.
According to Hdt.‚ the Pythia did not name Miltiades to the
Dolonci, but told them to ask their first entertainer to lead them.

14. Pythia: in the most 'ancient times Delphi, a chief seat of
the worship of Apollo, was called Pytho, Apollo the Pythius, and
his priestess‚ the Pythia. She uttered the oracles while seated
upon a tripod or three-legged stool; but as the sounds she made
were unintelligible to questioners, they were taken down by priests
of the temple, aud in the form of hexameter verse communicated
to inquirers. '

14. ut . . .si1merent: translate by an Eng. infinitive.

15. id si fecissent, etc. .· Nepos suddenly drops into indirect
discourse, leaving us to supply dixit from praecepit. Consequently
fecissent is not in a condition contrary to fact (“if they had done
tleis'’)‚ which would make nonsense, but stands for a fut. perf.
indic. The form of the oracle was, “ls they shall have done this.”

With futura supply esse, it is the principal verb in the indirect
discourse.

16. Hbc . . . respt'lnsb: in consequence oftleis reply, abl. of cause.

16. cum delecti t cum is of courseapreposition here. Begin the
translation of the whole sentence with the cum, when (cf cum,
p. 1, ll. 1 and 8), just before accessisset.

16. manu: note the two meanings the word has.

17. classe. . . profectus: translate by one word sail. The abl,
though unmodified‚ tells how the action of the verb was carried
on, hence expresses manner.

18. incolis: connect etymologically with a word used above.

19. facerent :=ut facerent, depends on postulasset, connected
by que to vellet; repeat cum in thought. ut is frequently omitted

. after certain classes of verbs (G. 565 and τις ll. 565, 4).
