118 NOTES.

first period of his presence, as then he held command; every-
thing else he may and probably did continue.

14. locus: properly an appositive with corones, but it has been
attracted, as is usual in Latin, into the relative clause and agrees
with the relative.

15· cum...tum: notonly...butalso.

17. clivi: this has reference to cylindrical pieces of wood
possessed by the ephors, and carried by all generals on expedi-
tions. It was usual for the ephors to wind a narrow strip of
’ leather slantwise around the wooden cylinder, and then to write
short secret dispatches lengthwise upon the leather. When the
leather was unrolled, merely a series of single letters appeared, ,
having no consecutive meaning. The officer receiving it would

wind it about a precisely similar cylinder, thus learning its con-

22. licet: should be a past tense as in the time of Nepos
there were no longer kings at Sparta.

23· ebrum: i.e., Lacedaemoniorum.

23· regi: Pausanias was regent for Pleistarchus‚ the son of

Leonidas, and consequently enjoyed a king’s rights.
26. quod . . . vocetur: this might have been qui . . ¹vocaretur,
attracted to llilhtee3 see on qui, p. 5, l. 6.

Paye 23. 1. Hilotae: slaves, tillers of the soil for the¹
individual Spartans; probably they were descendants of those of
