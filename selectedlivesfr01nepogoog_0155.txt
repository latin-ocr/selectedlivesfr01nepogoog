126 NOTES.

drrporwudm quod refers to the whole idea contained in the ex·
pression testarum suffragiis, hence the neuter.

5. exsilii: the Spartans, in serious plight owing‘to a rising
¹ of the Helots, sent to Athens for help. Cimon induced the
Athenians to send troops, butas the Spartans, becoming sus·
picious of them, sent the men back, the· people visited their in-
dignation upon Cimon, accusing him of being opposed to the
interests of the people and a sympathizer with Sparta. Probably
the reasons given in Milt. 8, 1, in the case of the father, apply
here also in the case of theson.

5. celerius: not strictly true, as Cimon wished to rejoin his
countrymen.at the battle of Tanagra (see below), but was not
allowed to do so. '

6. paenituit: impersonal as always, followed by accus. and
gen.

7. bellumque Lacedaemonii: the schemes of Pericles for ex-
tending Athenian sway over upper Greece received a check in the
defeat of the Athenians at Tanagra in Boeotia (458) by a Spartan
force ; after the victory the Spartans returned to Peloponnesus,

ιο. Post: separated from quam by tmesis ; thus frequently
priusqam, antequam always translate as one word at the point
where quam comes in the text.

10. expulsus etat: the perfect indicative usually follows post-
quam; but whenever a definite amount of time is given, the plu·
perfect is used. Cimon was recalled in 457 ; the fite years' peace
was not arranged till 4 51.

11. hospitio: almost all Greek states had their guest-friend-
ships. The socalled πρόξενοι, hospites, performed a duty sonte·
what similar to that of our modern consuls; but this difference
is to be noted : the American consul at Liverpool egis an Ameri-
can citizen who takes up his residence there when appointed ; the
Spartan representative at Athens was an Athenian. He, how·
ever, was expected to help and befn'end any Lacedaemonian who
came to Athens. See on hospitium, p. 16, l. 11.

13. sui sponte: tle. not sent officially; cf. the same words
in p. 22, l. 5.
