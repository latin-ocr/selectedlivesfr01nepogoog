156 NOTES.

15. ne . . . aliquis: more emphatic than ne . . ‚quis (G. 151, e;
H. 512) and strongly suggesting that by aliquis Diomedon him·
self is meant.

16. ereptum: Epaminondas means to imply that it Diomedon
should be robbed when going away from Thebes, he would spread

Ἴ the report that Epaminondas himself, having with a show of

virtue refused his offer of money, had had him robbed ot it.

17. delitum: as a present, lit. being offlred.

ro Athenis τ accus. expressing limit of motion after se deeset
velle to be supplied. Α

20. lleque verti :uon νόιός see on neque vert, p. 33, l. 20.

20. id satis habuit: wa's (not) satisfieri with this. ¹

21. ut escenderet: ie, to sail from Athens to Asia ; a result
· clause depending on effecit.

24· possumus: we'mtght, as it subjunctive. .

25.voli1mine: it was usual tor each book to be written
upon a separate roll, but in case or great length more were used,
that each roll might not be bullry. Notice the etymology and
compare volume in English¹ (See Fig.9 after note on vincla
epistulae, p. 23, l. 13, showing a case ot these rolls.)

Pagone. 1. quorum: sc. vitam the Latin rarely puts al>
straet or semi-abstract nouns in the plural; but we may translate
by the English plural.

r. separitim: the description of each occupying an entire
volumen. ⁸

r. versuum: note etymology; see group velim. As the books
were written on sheets fastened together in long strips and rolled,
the ancients used to number roll (volumen) and line (versus).

3. ut nemd: this seems slight praise if we compare l. 8, below;
but chap. 6 makes it clear that Nepos means to praise highly the
oratory of Epaminondas.

3. nemi Thehinus: see on ut neme, etc, p. 42, l. ro

4. neque: and to be sure not ; see on post, p. 28, l. 15.

nllow.
