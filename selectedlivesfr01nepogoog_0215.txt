186 NOTES.

ιο. iterum cbnsulem: this should read (Gracchum) bis ciu-
sulem and below Marcellum quintum ansulam, for Gracchus was
killed after the expiration of his second, Marcellus during his
fifth consulship.

ro. iuLiicinIs: join with sustulit; see on per ligures, p. 69, l. 6.

ro. absens: ie.. through his brother Mago.

13. Longum eat: it would be tedious, an expression of propriety
taking the indicative in Latin, but trans. as 'rt the subjunct.
(G. 522, a).

14. ex qud: atax οδ.

15. quamdiu . . . posuit: he was not defeated in Italy (il
we accept Nola). The rest of the statement is absurd.

18. defensum: cf dillberatum, p. 1, l. ro.

18. revocatus: ²03·

19. P. Scipiiuem: i.e., P. cornilius Sctpih, to which the
agnomen Africanus was added after his defeat of Hannibal. He
conquered all Spain between 210 and 206. In 204 he went over
to Africa from Sicily aud won a great battle near Utica, which
occasioned the recall oi Hannibal.

22. impraesentiarum: an adverb equivalent to lu praeseutia,
p. 8, l. 6; a colloquial expression probably from in praesentia
retum.

23. bellum compluere: cf. bellum compositurum, p. 37, l. zo.

· 24. In conloquium conve'nit, eta: a conserente is agreed repom
on terms they did not agree (lit. terms did nat meet).

2 5. Post id tactum: after this took place, lit. aster this deed.

26. Zamam: this was southwest oi Carthage. Itis thought
that Naraggara, which lay fifty miles to the west ui Zama, was
the scene of the battle ; the armies had encamped there prior to
the colloquy. Hadrumetum was not over oue hundred miles
from Zama, one hundred and fiftyfrom Naraggara; hence the
statement trecenta milia is an exaggeration. -

Pauo 71. abeat ab Zami: ab is used even with names of
towns when the distance from one place to another is stated.

’ 8. ἰοθπίηιό occupatus: most actively engaged.
